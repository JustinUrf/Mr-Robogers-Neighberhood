## Description

This website takes user input and creates an array that returns numbers that go from 0 to the user input. I.e input 5 returns a [0,1,2,3,4,5]. It is then manipulated and changed to "beep" if it contains a 1, "boop" if it contains a 2, and "won't you be my neighbor" if it contains a 3. This manipulation is hierachal and containg a "3" takes priority of containg a 2. i.e "23" will be "won't you be my neighbor" and "12" will return boop instead of beep.
